# 🍕 Pandas Pizza Sales EDA

## A complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project where I analyzed 48,000+ pizza orders using Pandas, extracted business insights, and prepared clean visual summaries.
## Project Overview
  This project explores a pizza company’s sales dataset consisting of:
	•	orders.csv
	•	order_details.csv
	•	pizzas.csv
	•	pizza_types.csv

The dataset includes order timestamps, quantities, pizza categories, sizes, and pricing.
Using Python (Pandas), I performed data cleaning and analysis to find trends, revenue patterns, and customer preferences.

## Objectives
 •	Clean and preprocess raw CSV files
 •	Extract date/time features
 •	Join relational tables
 •	Calculate revenue, quantity trends, and top-selling pizzas
 •	Analyse sales by:
 •	Day of the week
 •	Hour of the day
 •	Pizza category
 •	Pizza size
 •	Individual pizzas
 •	Generate actionable insights

 ## Techniques Used
  •	merge, groupby, agg
  •	sort_values, value_counts
	•	dt.date, dt.hour, dt.weekday
	•	Feature engineering
	•	Revenue calculation
	•	Time-based EDA
